# Ethereum Analytics

Models, case-studies, and general analytics on Ethereum usage. Our current focus is general network usage and optimization potential - the goal is to establish a small set of data visualizations as initial proof-of-concept

## Getting Started

Clone repo and run any model using python3.x.x

### Prerequisites

Python 3 for models, any additional dependencies are outlined within the model you're toying with, papers should be available in .pdf and .tex

### Contributions 

We love contributors and any models you build can be included via Pull Requests; review will occur ASAP

Over time, models and statistics will become out-of-date and updates are encouraged

The goal is to seperate papers and studies from models, but if a paper accompanies a model free to keep them together
